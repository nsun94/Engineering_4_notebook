### Reflection
The assignment itself was not difficult, the only issue I had was when I was making my computer the screen but it was just a typo.


## Getting Pi Online

### Reflection
I had issues getting it connected to the internet but I soon realized that there was a space after my password which caused it to mess up, after that it was smooth sailing.

### Reflection
The code itself for the assignment was not difficult but my indentation caused some errors while running it, but those problems were resolved.

### Reflection

this assignment was definetly the most challenging so far, I was familiar with mod because of my CS class. Nothing crazy.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty hard, I was familiar with arrays from my CS class but I just had to get used to them on python.

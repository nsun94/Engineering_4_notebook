## Getting Pi Online

### Description
The goal of this assignment is to get out Pi connected to the internet, I had issues getting it connected but I soon realized that there was a space after my password which caused it to mess up, after that it was smooth sailing.

### Description
The goal of this assignemnt is to create a program that prompts the user to click enter which makes the program select a random number, this loop continues until the user clicks X, which is the sentinel value. The code itself for the assignment was not difficult but my indentation caused some errors while running it, but those problems were resolved.

### Description

The goal of this assignment is to create a program that prompts the user for 2 numbers, then the program finds the sum, difference, product, quotient, and mod of the numbers. This assignment was definetly the most challenging so far, I was familiar with mod because of my CS class. Nothing crazy.

### Description

The goal of this assignment is to create a program that prompts the user to enter 3 values to plug into the quadratic formula. This assignment was pretty hard, I was familiar with arrays from my CS class but I just had to get used to them on python.

## GPIO Pins - Bash 
### Description
  The goal of this assignment was to get an LED to blink 10 times. This was a good introduction to Bash, the two languages have different syntax, but implement the same logic.

## GPIO Pins - Python
### Description
This assignment was very similar to the previous assignment, I got an LED to blink using python. Google helped a lot for this assignment.
